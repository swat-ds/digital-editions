## Instructions on how to annotate PDF.

- To annotate a pdf in the browser, please open google chrome. Search for "hypothesis extension" then select "add it to chrome".
- Lastly, open your extensions by going to "window" then clicking on "extensions". Click on "details" in hypothesis. At the bottom, activate "Allow access to file URLs" and you are set! Refresh your page and from now on for the rest of the semester you should be able to annotate PDFs.

You can also see the instructions [here](https://web.hypothes.is/help/annotating-locally-saved-pdfs/)

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any issues or questions at rvargas1
