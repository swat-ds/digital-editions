Hall’s framework defines the tenuous relationship between the various classes in the pursuit to possess the popular cultural consciousness: in which relationships of control and subordination are constantly shifting. Popular culture, in his definition, does not appear to belong to the people, in contrast to the high bourgeois culture. Rather, it both subverts dominant culture and is instrumentalised by the bourgeois institutions to affect popular consciousness. I argue that BAW/TAF (The Border Art Workshop/Taller De Arte Fronterizo)—an artist collective involved in addressing the cultural constructions and the confrontations at the Mexico-US border—and its operations in the late 1980s and early 1990s epitomise this struggle for the *popular* on multiple operational levels.

BAW/TAF, long before the Gramscian pronouncement became fashionable in public policy circuits, embedded in its art the belief that political actors are not merely responding to the woes of the nation—they retain agency over manufacturing these woes for the public as well. Instead of viewing the state as this enactor of enforcement around the public’s xenophobic anxieties (of drugs and illegal immigrants), especially in the Cold War era, BAW/TAF saw the state instilling those anxieties through skilful “use [of ]images, symbols and language” to fulfil their objectives.

Responding to the hegemonic control of the state over the popular culture/narrative around migrants at the US-Mexico border, BAW/TAF aimed to explicitly redefine the cultural practices around the border, to oppose truisms of porto-Fox News media coverage. Prior to their interventions, for instance, media referred to those crossing the border as “illegal aliens”—a phrase which institutionalised their otherness, justifying their domination and exploitation the moment they agreed to cross the border. BAW/TAF’s interventions, instead, led to the surfacing of the term “undocumented worker/immigrant”.

The act of opposing the semantic assertion of the term “illegal aliens” did not simply undertake the avant-garde agitation of the status quo in the state markers of migration, but, through the widespread use of term alternative term, highlights the reason for their illegality and provides relief in the simple solution of documentation. The lawless immigrant, in their felony of illegal migration, is not at fault, but rather the lawful systems that deny their documentation. Like BAW/TAF’s conceptual gesture to hold up mirrors against the headlights of the right-wing artivists on the border, the instrumentalisation of the popular culture by BAW/TAF glared back the headlights of the state-hegemon onto itself, to blame it for constructing a provocative crisis narrative that promotes disenfranchisement. Institutional criticism followed artist’s role as a constructor of culture.

This temporal shift in the drivers of the border culture, from the bourgeois state to the artist-activist, made the border an active site of the struggle for popular culture. This struggle extended beyond the state-activist binary—the hegemonic operations permeated into the realm of border art as it increasingly continued to occupy popular conscience.

As the wave of a continental “run for the border” was both caught and brought into popularity by BAW/TAF, border art became a hot and fundable theme in the art world; “everyone went to the border.” Guillermo Gomez-Pena—one of the original members of BAW/TAF—declared border art’s death as a casualty in the aforementioned struggle over this popular theme, for which he won the MacArthur Genius Award. In 1991, he blamed the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art—now the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art: an stakeholder in early border art—for bringing “the centre to the margins”, instead of “turning the margins into the centre.” He accused the museum of using BAW/TAF’s language to win grants for bringing “big names from out of town” to comment on the state of the border without recognising members that brought border art into the limelight. The museum claimed a hegemony of expertise over the popular border art realm without ever brushing up near the Mexico-US border.

This begets the question: who gets to make a claim upon border art? BAW/TAF has emerged in a triumphant period which, unlike Chicano Park, aimed to shed the separatism of Chicano nationalism and facilitate the creation of multicultural alliances. In all its inclusivist philosophy of utopian internationalism, why is BAW/TAF’s Gomez-Pena bordering off the artists—who broadly belong to the same political camp—from commenting on the state of the border? What makes the “big names from out of town” lack in the experience of the border; aren’t borders a global experience? When does Gomez-Pena, after winning the MacArthur Genius Award, transcend from the periphery into the centre and, consequently, lose his claim to a subaltern status on border art? Perhaps, Avalos is right when he writes about Gomez-Pena in “me n’ u,”

…he’d climbed to the top
of his pyramid scheme,
claiming a vantage from which he alone
had the privilege to observe
where everyone else was coming from.
(La Frontera 1993, 69)

Is Gomez-Pena using his privileged position, by accusing the museum of appropriating border art, to veil his own complicity with the the hegemonic centre? How far can we exclude artists from the realm of border art before we end up losing all allyship against the oppressive border conditions that plague today’s global neoliberal order, advancing fallacies of growth and prosperity?

Conclusion

These questions are not addressed to completion in Carroll’s chapter, and their absence suggests to us that the border—and border art—remains a disputed territory and, in the cited analysis, constitutes Hall’s definition of popular culture.

The first half of BAW/TAF’s account displays to us the contestations between the state and the activist-artist to preside over the popular narratives regarding
cross-border migration. The state-activist dichotomy is evident in the revolutionary theories of Latin American conceptualism that we have studied throughout this course. As we have witnessed aesthetics to become increasingly political and vice versa, the dealings have clearly revolved around subverting the traditional cultural authority fo the state-hegemon, to present a revolting, alternative narrative, to charge the public with a revolutionary conscience.

But, rather than imagining a popular culture as the voice of the subaltern/commons to revolt against the state’s narrative, through Hall’s framework, we can envision the popular culture as a contested site for both the state and the activist, allowing us to imagine the popular arena as a “salpicon/compota” of stakeholders, all of whom are engaged in a struggle to dominate it. The later half of BAW/TAF’s account by Carroll, by displaying the construction of the institutional hegemon within the revolutionary border art realm, successfully points to the internal contestations within the Left: a partisan collective comprised of many such stakeholders.

One of the apprehensions in my previous response paper was that Camnitzer’s account was fetishising the revolutionary left, in its absence of internal conflicts within the left itself. Carroll’s analysis, accompanied with Hall’s framework, extends beyond the state-artivist binary and presents a more comprehensive account of the praxis that complicate socially-engaged art.
