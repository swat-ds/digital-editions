In his article, Any Day Now: Black Art and Black Liberation, Larry Neal proposes a vision for a Black Arts movement and a Black Arts "esthetic," while considering a number of contemporaneous movements including Black Power and many of the decolonization or Revolutionary movements occurring throughout Latin America, Africa, and other parts of the so-called Third World. Later, Stuart Hall wrote "Deconstructing the popular," where he discusses the study of popular culture and its status as a dialectical process between two competing cultures. Using Hall's framework, we can better understand how Neal's manifesto considers the dialectical, or oppressive, relationship between white culture and black culture in the United States. Neal elaborates a type of Black Arts movement which acknowledges the way popular culture is molded by processes, using these cultural inflection points to promote a new art made in the image of black people for black people. Ultimately, Hall's framework bears striking similarities not only to Neal's model, but also to the dynamic of oppressor and oppressed in Paolo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed and a number of other decolonial and liberation-focused texts.

Hall's framework is first useful in examining Neal's writing from the perspective of a dialectical relationship between two cultures. Hall states that "... what is essential to the definition of popular culture is the relations which define 'popular culture' in a continuing tension to the dominant culture." Here, popular culture cannot be understood without first investigating the cultural relationships or conflicts that contribute to its construction. In Neal's case, this 'tension' that constructs popular culture is felt between white culture and black culture: "We are made to evaluate our innermost impulses against his. And in the process we do ourselves great spiritual and psychological harm" (Neal 41). Neal observes that popular culture has been constructed by the white gaze and by white 'impulses'. Acknowledging this, Neal says, is the first step in understanding the need and the urgency for a cultural production which is not dictated by black people's oppressors.  

Hall's framework is further useful in analyzing the next step of Neal's proposition, that is, the replacement of one form of culture with another. Hall expands on his earlier statement, saying, "It [the study of popular culture] looks at the process by which these relations of dominance and subordination are articulated. It treats them as a process: the process by means of which some things are actively preferred so that others can be dethroned." Larry Neal visualizes this process of culture which is dethroned and culture which is preferred by describing the black aesthetic and alluding to the conflicts of liberation in the Third World. Larry Neal mentions that Frantz Fanon is a large contributor to the "Third World outlook" of Black Power. Fanon discusses how the colonial powers reshape colonized people's psyche to address the colonizer in their culture, which may contribute to Neal's insistence that Black Arts create a "black esthetic" meant for consumption by black people: "...art that addresses itself directly to Black people; an art that speaks to us in terms of our feelings and ideas about the world; an art that validates the positive aspects of our life style" (44). Hall's framework is useful in understanding cultural production by black artists as part of a larger process of change and, importantly, of preference. The creation of a black "esthetic" is not simply about creating new art, then, but also about consciously preferring and selecting this cultural production over that of the dominant culture. With this in mind, the processes that Hall describes can contain conflict, and Neal anticipates that the role of Black Arts may also include defending the new liberated (in other cases, decolonized) form of art: "If Black Revolutionary Cultural Consciousness is perverted by jive Negro hustlers and Madison Avenue freaks, it is our job to illustrate how that very perversion is consistent with the nature of the capitalistic, colonialistic and imperialistic monsters that now rule the planet" (50). Interestingly, Neal acknowledges that threats to a liberated cultural consciousness could come both from the oppressors and from members of the oppressed who have been conditioned to betray their interests. In this way, Black Arts must supplant white culture by liberating the consciousness of black people.

Paolo Freire's writings in Pedagogy of the Oppressed describe a similar phenomenon with relation to Freire's concept of dehumanization. Freire writes that, "Within history in concrete, objective contexts, both humanization and dehumanization are possibilities for a person as an uncompleted being conscious of their incompletion" (Chapter 1). This statement acknowledges that what Neal may refer to as a liberated consciousness can also be understood in terms of humanization and dehumanization. The perversion of consciousness discussed by Neil bears a striking similarity to the process of dehumanization that the oppressed undergo in Freire's text. Critically, Freire notes that all people can be humanized (liberated) if they act at the point where they are conscious of their position within the dialectic of oppressor and oppressed. Just as Neal claims the remedy to black conscious subjugation is through a Black Arts movement and Hall notes that subordinate cultures must be actively preferred in order to shape popular culture, Freire puts forth a vision for the humanization and liberation of the oppressed: "Only power that springs from the weakness of the oppressed will be sufficiently strong to free both. Any attempt to 'soften' the power of the oppressor in deference to the weakness of the oppressed almost always manifests itself in the form of false generosity; indeed, the attempt never goes beyond this." Here, Freire takes account of the dominant cultureï¿½s response to attempted cultural resistance and describes one of the many forms it can take.

Larry Neal's vision of Black Arts described a host of phenomena which related not only to the oppression of the black community in the United States, but also bore many similarities to texts written on popular culture, decolonization, and cultural oppression. By putting Neal's text in conversation with Fanon, Hall, and Freire, we can more thoroughly understand how processes of oppression and the conditioning of consciousness are intertwined. Ultimately, all these authors agree that for the oppressed or colonized culture to liberate itself, new forms of cultural production must replace the old, crucially stemming from the understanding and vision of the oppressed. This new cultural production will then lead to a liberation or humanizing effect that will not only change the landscape of popular culture or create a more positive image of the subjugated peoples, but also lead to the liberation of the oppressors from their abusive actions (Freire).
