In January 1972, two feminist art pieces were being unveiled to the public on opposite coasts of the United States. In Los Angeles, Womanhouse opened as a feminist art installation and an exhibition space organised by Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro, culminating the year-long incubation of the students of feminist art at California Institute of Arts. On the east coast, Faith Ringgold’s mural “For The Women’s House” was presented to the female inmates at Bronx’s Riker’s Island. This essay argues that the subversion of former’s deconstruction of white, middle-class women’s gender norms remains absent in the latter due to a fundamental lack of a freedom to subvert.

As Lippard notes, in the 1950s and 60s, the stereotypical role of a woman as belonging to a household was banished in the list of artists and artworks, both. Women were excluded, and barely taken seriously, if they were housewives, were married, or had a child. Consequently, the artistic methods associated with the feminine identity of the housewife—weaving, knitting, ceramics, etc.—were mocked and, therefore, and avoiding by “serious” women artists. Even as men continued to claim their literally sculpted household items as breakthroughs in Pop Art, domestic imagery from a woman’s brush was not considered art.

When Chicago, Schapiro, and their students, decided to turn 742 Grandview, Los Angeles into a community art gallery and centre for their feminist art program at California Institute of Arts, they role against this exclusionary trend of all things feminine. And, in fact, marched forth to work exclusively out of material pertaining to the banished household aesthetic, reclaiming it in the name of feminism. A bathroom with menstrual hygiene products and lipsticks, crocheted art, personal spaces and shoe closets, a detailed dollhouse—all themes around the domestic life of women as a housewife, but with a morbid twist. The bathroom and personal spaces are dimly lit with the products overflowing into chaos, the crocheted fabric becomes cob webs, and the dollhouse is sexualised.

The critics of the household approach of Womanhouse may argue that the use of such stereotypically gendered content, albeit in the effort of reclamation, is reiterating male gaze in the representation of women. However, the treatment of such medium serves an important distinction. This loud household imagery in the artworks that constituted the space of Womanhouse were deconstructed, through the repetition of these tropes and the explicit morbidity in their display. "The Kitchen" presents itself as the epitome of this phenomenon, as the myth of a conventional kitchen outgrown into a dystopia. The kitchen is dimly lit in the alarming monochromatic shade of red, with the chaos of eggs stuck to all its walls, their yolks dripping down into breasts. The light pierces the scene through a pair of tattered curtains, to signify a violent escape from the absurd monotony of the kitchen. It is precisely in this absurdity, akin to scene in "23 quai du Commerce" by Jeanne Dielman, that the socialisation of the kitchen as an environment which "belongs" to women (and supposedly where they thrive) crumbles under the individuality of a woman that desires to escape the claustrophobic confines of the kitchen.

In subverting the sexist gender demarcated roles of women as domestic goddesses does Womanhouse locate feminist liberation. By deconstructing oppressive stereotypes, it calls for women to abandon the male fiction in which they live in. For the students in the program, it took not only extensive emotionally challenging work on their part—as Schapiro notes—but also the isolated utopia that freed them and their artwork from the male gaze, among the solidarity of likeminded women. The physical and metaphorical reclamation of the house, as a site of female oppression, required the institutional capital for the actual house and for instating a women-only art program. For the imprisoned women, who are majority of colour, their institutionalization within the racist carceral state did not accompany the freedom to mobilize for a feminist subversion, like the white, middle-class women of Womanhouse could.

Much like, if not more gravely, the introduction of stereotypically feminine household imagery and identities, the inscription of incarcerated women of colour into art was a feminist effort by Ringgold. She describes the stigma against an incarcerated woman as a “threatening one because … of how dare her not be a good wife and mother.” She goes to jail because of her inability to conform to traditional gender roles. However, instead of possessing the freedom to escape their household like their white counterparts, the women of colour of Riker’s are imprisoned at an overwhelmingly 85% of the total demographic. While they may also remain in an environment free of the male gaze, the remain oppressed by the carceral state systems and its panopticon prisons, under the surveillance of the correction officers. While Schapiro boasts about Womanhouse program exhibiting a collaborative non-hierarchical leadership structure, Ringgold barely managed the permission to put a mural into existence. Is it fair to compare the effectiveness of their strategies of solidarity, provided such disparate contexts and asymmetric power relations?

Womanhouse was opened for display to an audience wider than just the women involved in its art-making. It claimed to generate a lot of emotive response from the women attendees, by by making apparent the oppression of white, middle-class women. Such a process, as Schapiro claims, took immense toll on the artists to denaturalise internalised gender categories. It would be immensely brutish, according to Ringgold, to subject Riker’s incarcerated women to such mental anguish. “I didn’t want to add to their problems. I wanted it to be uplifting, inspiring, forward-moving, hopeful; I wanted it to give the woman some reason to be proud of themselves and to believe in themselves.” A blatant engagement with oppressive politics of victimhood was only reasonable for those participating in Womanhouse, Riker’s women needed something more hopeful; their position did not lend them the privilege to be critical of their own oppression.

### Conclusion

Womanhouse participated in feminist liberation through the deconstruction of gender roles that oppress white, middle-class women. Such a subversive act, however, could not (and should not) be reproduced with the incarcerated women of Riker’s, in the status of severe curtailment of their freedoms under the racist carceral state. Ringgold, ultimately, concludes that hope, albeit a long process, is what will foster feminist racial solidarity among these women.

Womanhouse claims to speak only for white, middle-class women in its feminist approach. However, comparing the case to Ringgold’s mural at Riker’s, it refuses to even acknowledge other feminist struggles or recruit artists of colour. And it fails to realise its complicity in the oppression of other women on grounds of race and class. Under bell hooks’ critique of white feminism and its inability to foster political solidarity, even though Womanhouse was emancipatory to a certain, privileged set of women, is it truly feminist? As the women of colour incarcerated at Riker's prison still reserve an overwhelmingly 85% of the population share, one is compelled to question Womanhouse's commitment to change-making.
